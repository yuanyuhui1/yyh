-------------
-removed bug with naming of recursive DEFINES
-shared Descriptors are named sharedTypeDescriptorX with Type beiing the appropiate type of the descriptor
-removed a bug when a generated table got no type name
-solves Bug subGen_16 (No void type is added if no type is specified for a function parameter type)

-solves Bug frw_13 (SubSystem Identification)
-solves Bug subGen_9 (unhandled exception in Subsystem Code Generator)
-solves Bug subGen_11 (Subsystem Code Generator Defines Handling)

-Descriptors are declared static

2.1.1 Build 6

-Improved naming convention (uppercase/lowercase) in Subsystems.
-Subsystems generated with release 5 or before may require manual touching

-Porting source code to Build 6:
 Regenerate the subsystem from scratch with the new release of subgen.
 It is suggested to make a backup copy of the subsystem, delete the .c and .h files and regenerate the subsystem.
 Then, copy the parts of code that have been written manually (execute methods and the like) to the newly generated source.

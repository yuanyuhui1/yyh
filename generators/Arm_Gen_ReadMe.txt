Change History
==============

1.2.1
  2010/02/09
  - Arm_Gen.cpp function WriteARMFile(): for table-per-subsystem, added "NULL" terminator to accessRightTable<Client>[].
    This is designed to work with the revision to the ARM subsystem (ver.1.1.3) "GetAccessRightsTable_ARM()" function.
  - Upversioned to 1.2.1.

1.2.0
  2009/08/05
  - Removed inclusion of header file "arm_compiletimedefinitions.h"
  - Upversioned to 1.2.0 (was showing "1.1.4", not "1.1.3" as labelled).

Beta 1.1.3
  2009/03/18
  - The project is now parsed to capture all T_DATA_OBJ's used. This means Arm_Gen must be located in "Generators" folder
    (else user can locate both this .exe, and the .csv file, in the Project root as an alternative).
  - User can now select:
   - "Generate table per subsystem", results in faster access times to locate table objects, and/or 
   - "Exclude non-writeable objects from table", results in reduced table size(s).

Beta 1.1.2
  2007/10/03
  - Enhanced functionality to interpret subsystem names according to varying styles of Client-generated output, eg:
    subsystem names maybe given as SecondaryCalcs, or secondarycalcs; the ARM gen will output SECONDARYCALCS_IDX in either case.

Beta 1.1.1
  2007/07/13
  - The accessRightTableHmi and accessRightTableHart generated by ArmGen now declared as const.
  - Changes to ensure that object and attribute names comply with the naming convention.

Beta 1.1.0
  2007/01/19
  - Enhanced functionality to interpret subsystem names according to varying styles of Client-generated output, eg:
    subsystem names maybe given as SECONDARYCALCS_IDX, or SECONDARYCALCS; the ARM gen will output SECONDARYCALCS_IDX in either case;
    object names maybe given as SECONDARYCALCS_IDX_alarms, or alarms; the ARM gen will output SECONDARYCALCS_IDX_alarms in either case;


Beta 1.0.0
  2006/10/09
  - Initial version.
